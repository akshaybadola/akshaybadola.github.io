	<h1 align="center">Sending Mail with Python and Googleapi for Emacs</h1>
<p>So I love Emacs. Why I love it would be the subject of another blog post, but as I love it I want to do everything from it, including sending and reading mail as it is very convenient for me. Emacs can automate a lot of tasks for me.</p>
<p>Anyway so <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/">mu4e</a> does a really good job of indexing and reading mails in emacs. It has a good compose feature also and it leaves receiving and sending mail up to the mail client of user’s choice.</p>
<p>For receiving mail I’ve been using <a href="http://www.offlineimap.org/">offlineimap</a> which also does a fairly good job. It’s not fussy and works as expected. The problem I faced is with sending mail. <a href="http://www.offlineimap.org/">offlineimap</a> can work with <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap/xoauth2-protocol">xoauth2</a> (xoauth2 is a variant of Oauth with some custom extensions by Google) and I have indeed retrieved and stored tokens for it which it can use to fetch my mail. And earlier I was using Emacs’s <code>smtpmail-send-it</code> to send mail. The problem occurs with the <code>auth-source</code>, the backend Emacs uses to authenticate with any server.</p>
<p>Now I did find this <a href="https://github.com/ccrusius/auth-source-xoauth2">auth-source-xoauth2</a> and it works fine actually, but…and it’s a very annoying but, sometimes <code>smtpmail-send-it</code> does not authenticate and gives me a <code>334</code> error (authentication required). And it happens often enough for me to get irked.</p>
<p>So the solution? One solution would be to use <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a> to send mail and actually I did install <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a> to see if I could configure Emacs for it, but it proved to be overkill for my use. It’s supposed to be a general purpose mail server and there are too many configurations and plugins for my simple use case.</p>
<p>So after a bunch of research (at which I’m fairly good) and hacking, I discovered that google has fairly good python library [https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client] with a fairly extensive set of features. And sending mail from it is not that difficult and decided to write a simple server which can send mail instead of <code>smtpmail-send-it</code>.</p>
<p>What it does basically is given a mail message in a proper format with all correct fields and boundaries, it reads the credentials from a <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">password store</a>, stored as a JSON formatted string and initiates a <code>service</code> instance. From that we can send and receive mail messages, and we only need the send part of that.</p>
<p>I’ve made it a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">flask</a> server so it only needs to read the credentials once from the store at startup, so I don’t need to feed them again after the timeout expires to emacs in case I need to send the mail later. You can take a look at it <a href="https://gist.github.com/akshaybadola/cb41f5e8a4bde80dd9d5d191d4afd41f">here</a>.</p>
<p>OK, fine you ask, but who’ll format the message and attachments and insert proper fields? Why, Emacs of course! Instead of launching a network process, we simply send to <code>gmailer</code> instead. I’ve posted that function as a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/akshaybadola/862c01471f899afdc7a8970de1b5052c">here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/">mu4e</a> and <code>smtpmail</code> do all the hard work and we steal the final product and dump it to the google client! Problemm solved (for now, until the bugs come :-D). I’m sure there’ll be bugs, but I’ll keep maintaining the gists and if required gather them into a repo. Happy Emacs’ing!</p>
