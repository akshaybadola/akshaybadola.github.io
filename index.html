            <h4>Conway’s law and communication networks</h4>
             I’ve been working in this (stealth as of now) startup for more than a month now and although it’s smaller than the one where I had worked prveviously, I’m quite intrigued by the communication structures and the inefficiencies that I perceive because of them. One key difference here is that I have to coordinate across mutliple teams (two as of now) with different skills and specializations and as such, I can see certain patterns of communication emerging and which also makes me think of Conway’s law:...

            <h4>About the interview with an old actor</h4>
             I had this dream a while back  I was interviewing an actor about a movie at a dinner hosted in his honor. He’s an old man and a few of his friends are also there, they’re also mostly old people, some actors and journalists. The film itself was directed by Herzog but he’s not there. It was based on a novel by Dostoyevsky. I ask the actor to explain the crux of the film and he’s reluctant perhaps with the thought that it’s useless to summarize such philosophy and beauty in a few sentences. The best books and films have to be seen after all, and can never be described adequately. I remember that I had only asked so that I could then present my point of view which would be undoubtedly more profound. I feel that actors less than directors aren’t given to great philosophy....

            <h4>Sending Mail with Python and Googleapi for Emacs</h4>
            So I love Emacs. Why I love it would be the subject of another blog post, but as I love it I want to do everything from it, including sending and reading mail as it is very convenient for me. Emacs can automate a lot of tasks for me. Anyway so mu4e does a really good job of indexing and reading mails in emacs. It has a good compose feature also and it leaves receiving and sending mail up to the mail client of user’s choice....

            <h4>Python Functional Programming Example</h4>
            So I was working on my ref-man emacs package and I had made some additions which incorporate a local python flask server running on it which fetches data from from dblp API, arXiv API and also I’m adding semantic scholar support. Originally there was only dblp calls so I had to modify the functions and I took a functional programming approach, by generating partial functions and using them to modify the existing code as I modified my existing implementation....

            <h4>The Politician</h4>
            I’m too old to be watching TV (or web) series. I think too much. My mind finds patterns in things which maybe aren’t there and I feel there’re many powerful undercurrents to “The Politician” on Netflix which makes me love it. If you haven’t heard of it yet, it’s about this young man who’s tried to plot his course towards the US Presidency for as long as he can remember. He’s studied all the facets and requirements, he’s traced everything in common and he pursues his goal without qualms and seemingly without a conscience....

            <h4>Dropout and Regularization</h4>
            First mention of dropout is found in (Hinton et al. 2012). That paper talks about preventing feature correlation in neural networks. Dropout was applied successfully in (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) after which it gained widespread popularity. It was shown to be effective in Recurrent Neural Networks for the first time in (Zaremba et al. 2014). Historically, neural network pruning was an effective way to prevent overfitting of neural networks (Hassibi and Stork 1993; LeCun et al. 1990). These methods used ideas from perturbation theory to minimize the change in second order gradients (hessian)....
