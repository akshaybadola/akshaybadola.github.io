            <h4>Sending Mail with Python and Googleapi for Emacs</h4>
            So I love Emacs. Why I love it would be the subject of another blog post, but as I love it I want to do everything from it, including sending and reading mail as it is very convenient for me. Emacs can automate a lot of tasks for me. Anyway so mu4e does a really good job of indexing and reading mails in emacs. It has a good compose feature also and it leaves receiving and sending mail up to the mail client of user’s choice....

            <h4>Python Functional Programming Example</h4>
            So I was working on my ref-man emacs package and I had made some additions which incorporate a local python flask server running on it which fetches data from from dblp API, arXiv API and also I’m adding semantic scholar support. Originally there was only dblp calls so I had to modify the functions and I took a functional programming approach, by generating partial functions and using them to modify the existing code as I modified my existing implementation....

            <h4>The Politician</h4>
            I’m too old to be watching TV (or web) series. I think too much. My mind finds patterns in things which maybe aren’t there and I feel there’re many powerful undercurrents to “The Politician” on Netflix which makes me love it. If you haven’t heard of it yet, it’s about this young man who’s tried to plot his course towards the US Presidency for as long as he can remember. He’s studied all the facets and requirements, he’s traced everything in common and he pursues his goal without qualms and seemingly without a conscience....

            <h4>Dropout and Regularization</h4>
            First mention of dropout is found in [1]. That paper talks about preventing feature correlation in neural networks. Dropout was applied successfully in [2] after which it gained widespread popularity. It was shown to be effective in Recurrent Neural Networks for the first time in [3]. Historically, neural network pruning was an effective way to prevent overfitting of neural networks [4], [5]. These methods used ideas from perturbation theory to minimize the change in second order gradients (hessian)....
